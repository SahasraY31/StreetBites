# StreetBites
We used MySQL to build tables in the database to keep track of users/owners, food truck information, and also preferences(tags). 
We used PHP to create login & registration information and to also display all of our data.
We used HTML, JavaScript, and PHP to make the map and display the markers. 
Finally, we used CSS to style elements and make sure everything was consistent with our color palette and logo.
